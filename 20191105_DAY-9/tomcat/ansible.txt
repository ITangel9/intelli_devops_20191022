Configuration Management :
    1. Pull Based : Chef & Puppet 
        - Agent Software is required
        - Ruby DSL

    2. Push Based : Ansible & Salt 
    Ansible:
        - No Agent or Agentless
        - SSH 
        - Python 
        - Open Source

        - in 2015 Redhat has acquired Ansible 
    Configuration Management, Deployment & Provisioning etc.. 

1. What is Ansible?
Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration-management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task-execution, and multinode orchestration - including trivializing things like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers.

2. Why Ansible?

    - OpenSource
    - Easy to Learn 
    - Easy Installation & Configuration steps 
    - No need of Agent installation on Nodes
    - Highly Scalable 
    - Python 
    
3. How Does Ansible Work?
    - With the help of Ansible Playbooks, which are written in very simple language, YAML 

Requirement : Install new version of Tomcat part of all the stages :

Ansible Master ---: 
    SSH-Keys :
        Keys : PublicKey and PrivateKey 

    Stages :
        - dev :
            - 4
        - tst :
            - 8
        - acc :
            - 8
        - prd :
            - 40 +
